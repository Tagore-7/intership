Track-workplace-condition-to-ensure-employee-safety-in-ware-house

In this project we have used Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) to train a model that can predict if a employee is wearing the helmet or not while working in a warehouse, model is trained using Tensorflow Backend Libraries and we have acheived over 93% accuracy, The project is in ready to deploy in various warehouses and industrial workplaces

Libraries used:

Tensorflow--https://www.tensorflow.org/

Numpy--https://numpy.org/

OpenCV--https://opencv.org/
